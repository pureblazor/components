# PureBlazor Components
PureBlazor Components built for the [PureBlazor CMS](https://pureblazor.com)

Demo: https://components.wasmhost.dev

# Getting started
These components are being built alongside (and for) the PureBlazor CMS. Our focus is supporting the CMS first and foremost.

In order to use these components, the current recommendation is to add this repository as a submodule (or fork this repo). We will eventually add these components to Nuget when time permits.
